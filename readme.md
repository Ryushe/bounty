# Bounty Hunting tools
This repo will contain some scripts, configs, wordlists, etc that I create to help automate my hunting journey. 

In the future I plan on creating major tools as well (which will gain their own repo)
## amass.sh
Runs amass on all urls in urls.txt (within the dir) 
## crt.sh
Gets the crt info of the urls.txt
## set zap scope
creates the config file that zap can injest (from a list of urls)
